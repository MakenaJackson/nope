    <h1>Acquavella Galleries, Gagosian and Pace to Handle Sale of Donald B. Marron Family Collection</h1>

<h2>Good contemporary art reflects the society, and great contemporary art anticipates. by Donald B. Marron</h2>

<p>In an unprecedented move, Acquavella Galleries, Gagosian and Pace Gallery have joined forces with the Marron family to handle the sale of the Donald B. Marron Family Collection. The collaboration will pay homage to Don Marron’s (1934–2019) legacy as one of the 20th and 21st centuries' most passionate and erudite collectors, a pioneer of corporate collections, a family man, and a dedicated philanthropist. Over the course of six decades, Marron acquired over 300 modern and contemporary masterworks.</p>

<p>In May 2020, the three galleries will organize a joint exhibition in New York to showcase the breadth of the Marron family collection. The exhibition will be divided Into three significant phases of Marron’s collecting activities, including his work as a young collector in the 1960s and 1970s, as a museum steward, and as a pioneer in reinventing how corporations build art collections around a singular vision. The exhibition will include works from the family collection as well as loans from institutions.</p>

<p>The Marron family collection includes two major paintings by Pablo Picasso,<em> Femme au béret et à la collerette (Woman with Beret and Collar)</em> (March 6, 1937) and <em>Femme assise (Jacqueline)</em> (May 13–June 16, 1962); Mark Rothko’s <em>Number 22 (reds)</em> (1957); Cy Twombly’s <em>Untitled (Camino Real)</em> (2011); paintings by Willem de Kooning and Gerhard Richter, and significant works by Brice Marden, including <em>Complements</em> (2004–07). Marron also supported generations of rising artists of significance, and the collection reflects this with recent works by Mark Bradford, Mark Grotjahn, and Laura Owens.</p>
