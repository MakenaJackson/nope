    <h1>Rebelion Against the Grid</h1>


<p>The revolution in computing and design software began in the 1970s, took hold in the 80s and 90s, and continues to this day. As well as rapidly changing the tools and techniques used by typesetters and printers, it created new opportunities for experimentation amongst designers.</p>

<p>In the era of analog printing presses and movable type, grids were a critical tool in allowing typesetters and printers to organize text and other graphic elements in a consistent and reproducible way. It was possible to break the grid and manipulate type, as Wolfgang Weingart did while a printing apprentice. However, achieving these effects meant subverting how conventional printing presses were designed to work.</p>

<p>With the arrival of desktop publishing, suddenly these technical and formal constraints—which had both informed and reflected the use of grids in graphic design—were removed.</p>

<p>Using early graphic design software like Pagemaker and Photoshop in the late 80s and early 90s, grids could be changed at the click of a mouse. A block of text could be resized and made to re-flow on screen. Images could be rotated, distorted, and layered. Whole publications could be mocked up quickly and cheaply on screen, without having to commit each experiment to a costly printing process.</p>

<p>This opened up a new era of experimentation in graphic design—one of the clearest historical illustrations of how new technical tools and constraints can drive the creation of novel work.</p>

<p>One of the best known figures to emerge from the experimentation of the 1980s and 1990s was David Carson, a professional surfer who developed an interest in graphic design, and initially learned his trade through a two-week graphics course at the University of Arizona, another short course in Oregon, and a 3-week workshop in Switzerland. Carson is one of the finest examples of how to become a designer without going to design school.</p>

<p>Carson worked on a number of skateboarding and snowboarding magazines in his early career (as did Aaron Draplin), but he really came to prominence when he was hired to design Ray Gun. These designs are notable for a number of breaks with graphic design convention, including the use of standard grids. It’s important to notice that the reason Carson’s designs are still visually effective, though, is that they still adhere to important principles of visual organisation, such as a contrast, balance, and proximity.</p>

<p>Also, there are typically also enough grid elements left intact to preserve the design’s fundamental purpose–to communicate meaning. For example, in the articles pictured below, although the columns of text are of different widths and are not separated by a gutter, each block of text still adheres to a baseline grid and clear left-and-right boundaries, meaning that the text ultimately remains readable. (Although this is not the case for the article about Bryan Ferry—which Carson disliked and therefore set entirely in Zapf Dingbats.</p>
